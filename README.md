## 📖 Overview
**NeuroVoice AI** is an end-to-end medical screening tool designed to detect early vocal biomarkers associated with **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**. 

Unlike traditional "Black Box" AI models, this system is built on **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles. It uses advanced signal processing to extract micro-tremors from voice recordings and provides a transparent, clinically interpretable risk assessment.

### 🌟 Key Innovation: The "Real-World" Calibration
Most voice AI models fail outside the lab because they confuse **Microphone Noise** with **Neurological Tremors**. 
* **The Challenge:** Consumer laptops have a high noise floor (Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
* **My Solution:** I engineered a **Dynamic Calibration Engine** that scales the risk probability based on the audio's HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio). This effectively "subtracts" the hardware noise, preventing false positives for users with cheap microphones.

*The dashboard features a dynamic Risk Gauge, real-time Biomarker Cards (Jitter/Shimmer), and a downloadable Clinical Report.*

## 📊 Model Performance
The model was trained on the **UCI Parkinson's Dataset**, a gold-standard collection of biomedical voice measurements.

### **Test Set Metrics (20% Holdout)**
| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **89.74%** | Highly accurate classification |
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.9655** | Excellent separation between Healthy/PD |
| **Precision (PD)** | **0.93** | 93% of identified cases were correct |
| **Recall (PD)** | **0.93** | Caught 93% of actual PD cases |

### **Detailed Classification Report**

This is the final touch. A `README.md` is the "Front Door" of your project. Recruiters often read *only* this file, so it needs to be perfect.

Here is a professional, portfolio-grade `README.md`. I have structured it to tell the **"Engineering Story"** (The Problem $\rightarrow$ The Solution $\rightarrow$ The Results).

### **Instructions for Images:**

Before pushing to GitHub, create a folder named `assets` in your repository and move these 4 images into it:

1.  **`assets/app_screenshot.png`**: Take a screenshot of your running app (the Gauge/Biomarker view).
2.  **`assets/shap_summary.png`**: The SHAP summary plot we generated in `train_final.py`.
3.  **`assets/confusion_matrix.png`**: The confusion matrix from `train_final.py`.
4.  **`assets/tsne_clusters.png`**: The t-SNE plot from your EDA step.

### **Confusion Matrix**

*The model correctly identified 27/29 Parkinson's patients and 8/10 Healthy controls in the blind test set.*

-----

## 🔬 Data Science Workflow

### 1\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before training, I used **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** to visualize the high-dimensional data in 2D.

  * **Insight:** The clear separation between Healthy (Green) and PD (Red) clusters confirmed that vocal features contain a strong predictive signal, validating the feasibility of an ML approach.

### 2\. Feature Engineering

  * **Signal Processing:** Used `Parselmouth` (Python wrapper for **Praat**) to extract 22 acoustic features.
  * **Selection:** Removed collinear features (e.g., `Jitter:RAP`, `Jitter:PPQ`) to prevent overfitting and improve model interpretability.
  * **Extraction Strategy:** Implemented a **"Stability Scout"** algorithm that scans the audio file window-by-window to find the single most stable 1-second segment, ignoring breath/start-up artifacts.

### 3\. Explainable AI (SHAP)

Medical AI must be transparent. I used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to break down *why* the model made a specific decision.

  * **Top Predictor:** **PPE (Pitch Period Entropy)** and **Spread1** were identified as the strongest biomarkers for Parkinson's, aligning with clinical literature on vocal rigidity.
