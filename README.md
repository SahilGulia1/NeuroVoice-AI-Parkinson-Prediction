## 📖 Overview
**NeuroVoice AI** is an end-to-end medical screening tool designed to detect early vocal biomarkers associated with **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**. 

Unlike traditional "Black Box" AI models, this system is built on **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles. It uses advanced signal processing to extract micro-tremors from voice recordings and provides a transparent, clinically interpretable risk assessment.

### 🌟 Key Innovation: The "Real-World" Calibration
Most voice AI models fail outside the lab because they confuse **Microphone Noise** with **Neurological Tremors**. 
* **The Challenge:** Consumer laptops have a high noise floor (Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
* **My Solution:** I engineered a **Dynamic Calibration Engine** that scales the risk probability based on the audio's HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio). This effectively "subtracts" the hardware noise, preventing false positives for users with cheap microphones.
